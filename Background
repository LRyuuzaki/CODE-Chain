As a developer, we can rarely develop for the benefits of ourselves, nor can we fairly enjoy the income the code brings to us.

For instance, the code we created may belong to the company, maybe shared for free use, or be Ctrl+C plus Ctrl+V by someone else. Actually, the wonderful code we created almost never truly belong to ourselves.

As another example, the code we write may bring value, convenience, and benefits to our society and users, but ultimately, only a small percentage of which can motivate us, or even cannot have any motivation for us at all.

Therefore, we urgently need such a development platform to fully protect the rights of our developers while ensuring the value of our code:

	CODE chain is based on blockchain and cryptography instead of credit, so that it can eliminate the possibility of code being stolen and can protect developers from frauds;
	It enables developers to own their code and enjoy its benefits. Developers can authorize others to create a product. 
	for ordinary users, such a peer-to-peer development system can protect them from fakes and help them get rid of phishing.
