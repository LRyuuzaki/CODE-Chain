# CODE-Chain
a new-style peer to peer development platform

Hi everyone, I’m L. I can be no one or anyone. I want to build a new-style peer to peer development platform CODE Chain, so that the code we submit can run and share procedures directly in a decentralized environment without any company or individual as intermediaries. 

L will practice the ideals of Satoshi Nakamoto, from the construction of the CODE chain to its functions and application development, and the achievement of which will be shared by all of you.

After the CODE Chain is officially launched, the income generated by our code will be automatically assigned to all code contributors.

Build a new Internet，by every L
