Currently, many blockchain projects claim that they will create decentralized technologies and applications, but for most projects, their community governance is centralized. Moreover, the development and operation team cannot truly realize decentralization because their community right is concentrated. In this way, the application will lose its meaning and this is contrary to the blockchain spirit.

CODE Chain believes that community and technology are equally important. CODE does not belong to anyone or organization from the beginning, and is built by the community in a decentralized way. L is the founder of the CODE Chain; L can be no one or everyone.

CODE Chain recognizes and believes in the concept of Satoshi Nakamoto, insisting on a completely decentralized community-based development mode. Therefore, the consensus of the community determines how far the CODE Chain can go. CODE rewards will be distributed during early development, and community participants can get CODE at low cost. When CODE chain is officially launched, all of these will depend on On-chain Contract. If you regard the On-chain Contract as real L, I will be very happy.
