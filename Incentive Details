Within the CODE ecosystem, we intend to use CODE as its sole incentive and commercial delivery medium.

7.1 Basic information
Total Circulation: 1 billion
Initial Price: ¥0.1
Proof Method: POC
Network Protocol: IPFS

7.2 Preliminary Developer Plan	
 
	Before the real CODE chain is developed, we will use the erc20 token on Ethereum to issue a portion of the CODE to encourage CODE developers. This part accounts for about 2% of total circulation.
	At the right time, the community will choose a global platform which is recognized by the users (developers) and is willing to support the concept of the CODE chain to proceed IEO. This will allow developers to obtain CODE coin at a lower cost for future development, debugging and operation on the CODE chain; it will also allow them to benefit from the development of the CODE chain. This part accounts for about 5% of CODE's total circulation.
	After the CODE chain is officially launched, all CODE based on ERC20 will be mapped to CODE coin according to the ratio of 1:1. The remaining 93% of the CODE coin will be fully mined on CODE chain by the way of POC.
